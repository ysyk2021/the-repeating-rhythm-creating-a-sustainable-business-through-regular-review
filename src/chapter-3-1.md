Regular review enables businesses to adjust their strategies as necessary based on changing circumstances. By monitoring market trends, tracking emerging technologies, and evaluating competitive landscape, businesses can identify opportunities for growth and adjust their strategies to capitalize on them.

Adjusting strategies as necessary ensures that businesses remain agile and responsive to changing market conditions, positioning themselves for sustained success over the long term.
