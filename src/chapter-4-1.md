Types of Reviews
=========================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of reviews that businesses can conduct to create sustainable business strategies and achieve long-term success.

Quarterly Reviews
-----------------

Quarterly reviews are a popular type of review used by many businesses. These reviews are conducted every three months and enable businesses to track progress towards objectives, identify areas for improvement, and adjust strategies as necessary.

Quarterly reviews typically involve collecting relevant data, analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying areas for improvement, and developing action plans to address them.

Annual Reviews
--------------

Annual reviews are another common type of review used by businesses. These reviews are conducted once per year and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the business's performance over the course of the year.

Annual reviews typically involve a more in-depth analysis of data and may include a review of the business's overall strategy, financial performance, customer feedback, employee performance, and industry trends. Based on the insights gained from the review, businesses can develop action plans to address areas for improvement and adjust their strategies for the coming year.

Continuous Reviews
------------------

Continuous reviews are an ongoing type of review that involves regularly collecting and analyzing data to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement. This approach allows businesses to quickly identify emerging trends and make adjustments to their strategies in real-time.

Continuous reviews typically involve monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) on a daily or weekly basis and using this data to inform decision-making and drive continuous improvement.
